`HaierACBridge` is Android app that exposes Haier devices to local network by REST API

## Notice

Under the Haier's SmartAir2 license I haven't decompiled any part of SmartAir2 app. My whole work is based on my research and resources found on the web. Only things I did with SmartAir2 app was observing logcat data and http/https request made by SmartAir2 app. Also I remind you that SmartAir2 belongs to Haier not me

## Features

- Every SmartAir2 controlled AC should work
- Easy to use REST API
- Automatic device detection (when you add new device in SmartAir2 it should automatically register within HaierACBridge)
- Created with privacy in mind

## Used by

- [homebridge-haieracbridge-platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-haieracbridge-platform)

## Installation

1. Install HaierACBridge app
2. Login with your SmartAir2 account
   1. If you want you can enable autorun with boot
3. It's should work now!
